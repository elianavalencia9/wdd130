    <p>Hello guys! I'm Eliana, I'm from Ecuador.  I live in Guayaquil.  I currently work as accounting assistant.  I love animals and nature and may be in a future I can become vetrinary.  I love reading books, watching movies and playing guitar.  I'm studying Applied Technology at BYUIdaho online because it's a good career.  What I love most about BYUIdaho is that it gives opportunity to people who wants to improve in their lives and the other that I also love about it is that I can learn more about Jesus Christ and be more near to Him always.</p>
    <p>Yes that's me!</p>
